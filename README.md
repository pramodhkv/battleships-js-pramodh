# Magnolia - Battleships code challenge

## Description

This is a simple battleships game. The game is played on a 10x10 grid. The program will place 3 ships at random locations on the grid. The ships are 1x5 and 2x4. The player can click anywhere on the grid to simulate shooting. The program will then respond with a hit or miss. The game ends when all ships have been sunk.

## Installation

To run this program, you will have to install the live-server extension for VS Code. This will allow you to run the server from within VS Code. To do this, go to the extensions tab and search for live-server. Install the extension and then click on the Go Live button in the bottom right corner of the editor.

Alternatively, you can also install live-server. If you don't have it installed, run the following command:

`npm install -g live-server`

Then run the following command to start the server:

`live-server`
